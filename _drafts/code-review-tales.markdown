First of all... I'M BACK! i had a hard weeks at home and office as well. But after all that stuff, i'm back with a small story.

I think that the post's photo summarizes all the code review stories, but i want to share this experience.

## The little project...

Today was the day... the day to make the code review of a few coworkers for the annually performance report.

A little bit of background, for the last few month me and 2 architects were working on a new and exciting project, we were able to use a lot of new technologies, design the base of something big. The dreaming project...

Then the day to put all that code to work arrived, 2 teams of 2 devs were assigned to work with us, one guy to make the backend and the other to make the frontend. The two teams were going to do the same module, to compare times, test the architecture, etc...
After two small sprints of two weeks, we had enough code to review and then it is when we got surprised.

## The session

Today after lunch me and other guy from the arch team reserved a room of the office for 4 hours to review the code of the other 4 guys. I was like '4 hours.. nah you are exaggerating', then i realized the naive of my thoughts.. the code review never ends.

We build all the base projects and tools to validate a lot of thing like code styles, file naming, tests coverage, code comments, etc. So we were very convinced that we are going to find only a few things.   

We end up amazed of the things that we saw in 4 hours. The most common thing was the damned cope&paste. We made a lots of examples code to avoid questions and make a record of examples. 
But this generated a bad behavior in the team, they copy and change a few things and thats all. The idea is not totally bad... but you need to change the name of the functions and variables... at least...
