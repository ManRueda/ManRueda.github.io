title: Hackintosh Asus s400ca-ca002h

I'm writing this entry in my almost fully working hackintosh, and i'm very happy to finally see it running.

A little back of history, i had tried to make it work numerous times in the pass but never with success. I even couldn't get the installer boot...
This month i decide to try it again, i don't know why really... maybe because of the apple style of this ultrabook, a lot of aluminium, black screen frame, etc.
