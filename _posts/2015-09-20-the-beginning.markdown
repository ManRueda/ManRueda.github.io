Hi everyone, i hope there is someone there...

Recently i was working a lot with TFS-Grunt integration and stuff like that and noticed that there aren't so much documentation or examples or anything about it, until there is almost nothing  about some libraries of TFS server side... it's like a dark side of the Microsoft doc.

So this last Friday i was bored at home and decided to start a blog (something new for me) to put all this things that i learned on my work on internet for everyone.

But... i did not want to create a Wordpress or Blogger (i'm not against those...) but it seemed so simple to simple to me... i want to do some work. So i searched for a customizable blogging platform to play with it.

That why i end up with **[Ghost](https://ghost.org/)** running in a **[Heroku](https://heroku.com/)** dyno... so the idea it's share the stuff i can and also play with this platform... 

I hope that all the things that are going to end up here helps you at some point...
