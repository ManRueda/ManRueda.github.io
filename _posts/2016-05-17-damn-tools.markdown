After an absence, _i had a hard time with housing issues and other job stuff_, i'm back with an small thought.

Last week i was surfing the web and watching videos when i saw [What editor do you use? - FunFunFunction #31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIjKJjzRX_E) by __[mpj](https://twitter.com/mpjme?)__.
In this video he talks about the IDEs, tools, etc and gives us his perspective, if you have a few minutes see it... he could leaves you thinking, like me.

_BTW if you didn't know mpj, take a look at his videos... are reaaally good_

Going back... the video left me thinking. One minute after finishing the video i was like __"uff the tools make my work easier... it make me more productive"__
But one or two hours later, i remembered last week i was coding in a nice project but, because of those problems that i mention at the begining, i was uninspired... and fooled myself creating a _"deploy notification extension"_ because that would make my work more fast.

So then i start thinking _"mpj words are not far away of my reality"_, i was hiding myself behind of that _extension_ to not work on the real project, maybe because of my no inspiration at that moment, _that is a thing for another time_.

Now... could this post... count as a distraction of my project..?
Naaah... i'm ok with this...
